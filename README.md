## üîç Objective

This repository is created for studying and reproducing the FALCON framework, which proposes a dual-agent reinforcement learning architecture for robust and generalizable humanoid loco-manipulation under external end-effector (EE) forces.

Through this project, I aim to:
- Understand the design of the dual-agent learning framework.
- Reproduce key simulation experiments.
- Analyze the torque-limit-aware force curriculum.
- Possibly extend the work to new locomotion tasks or robot platforms.
